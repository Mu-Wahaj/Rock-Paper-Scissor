Overview
This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in the classic hand game. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. This project helps to practice JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, event listeners, and basic conditional logic.
